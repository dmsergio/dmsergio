### Yep! I'm Sergio DÃ­az ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software backend developer living (and working) from Valencia, Spain :sunny::sunglasses:.

I've been building [Odoo](https://odoo.com) (open source ERP) addons for six years. After that I decided to make a change, and right now I am working in some solutions built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).


I'm a Python lover :heart::snake:, and everyday I try to learn more things related with this awesome programming language.
